# driving_data_project

Human behavior tends to be unique and every human seems to leave a fingerprint in different actions they perform which can be decoded through behavior analysis, research on a large scale is already being conducted to categorize and create a common taxonomy for human behavior. Applications such as video surveillance are already using human behavior analysis to bring out better reporting and improve response times in case of emergencies [1]. 
Similar to other activities leaving the human’s fingerprints, driving style is also a personalized and unique trait of each individual, research shows that humans exhibit different driving behaviors even in plain and traffic-free terrains [2]. Modern vehicles are equipped with computers onboard and with ICT development, modern vehicles are also connected to the internet [2]. While this brings some downsides of its own such as faulty software, hacking attempts, and so on, however, in this paper I will only discuss the door that it opens to protecting vehicles against theft. 
With computers on board, it is possible to record several aspects of a human’s driving aspects which can be used for behavioral analysis and a profile of the driver can be created, the same profile can be used to detect vehicle theft when there is a swift change in driving patterns and then appropriate actions can be performed to counter the theft.
In this paper I use a data set from HCRL [3], which contains driving data of ten drivers on the same route, I will perform the required data cleansing to remove the less important features of a human’s driving behavior, as well as remove some data which seems to be invalid or corrupt, after which exploratory analysis is performed to analyze different aspects of human driving behavior and establish a profile. The profile can later be used to detect if the current driver’s driving behavior does not match with the established profile, thus, indicating a theft.
Since driving is a time-dependent action and not a one-off attribute, a driver must drive for a minimum required duration or distance to be able to be classified into the owner/thief class.


# How to run
Please start with the notebook file, TechnicalProject_DrivingData - AF.ipynb
The python file detect_theft.py should be placed in the same location as the notebook file
The csv file Driving_Data(KIA_SOUL)1.csv should also be places in the same location as the notebook file
